Creating accessible web applications is difficult. It gets even harder if you don't understand how people with disabilities use computers.

With ARIA DevTools you see your website the way screen readers present it to the blind users. All page elements are presented according to their explicit or implied ARIA roles. This includes headings, images, tables and form items beyond others.

It's now easy to spot missing ARIA labels, misused ARIA roles, and incomplete keyboard support. This makes testing and development of accessible websites easier.

This extension is available for free for [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/aria-devtools/dneemiigcbbgbdjlcdjjnianlikimpck?hl=en) and [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/aria-devtools/).

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> Recently I've dropped my full time job to pursue a dream of being an independent developer working on my own projects. To make it sustainable I have to be very careful on what I spend my time on. I would love to work further on ARIA DevTools if I find a sponsor of the project (I don't want to make the extension paid). If you are interested feel free to contact me at mateusz@roombelt.com.
